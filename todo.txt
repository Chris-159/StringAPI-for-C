1.) I need to refactor the return types of the higher ranking functions (at the String objects).
    I think I will take the product of the functions return value with a predefined one, 
    so these values will be ranked in a hierarchy system:

CURRENT_FUNCTION: ret
    FUNCTION_1: ret * 10
        FUNCTION_2: ret * 100
            ...
                .
                .
                .
                FUNCTION_n: ret * (n * 10)

    Need to take into account, that after this the return value will be much higher or lower. 
    Currently the type is /char/ which only has the range of -128 to 127.
    This won't be enough in the case, where there are at least 3 functions.
    In this case the ouptut will be over 1000 or under -1000.
    I want to change the /char/ to /short/, but I have a lurking suspicion it won't be enough...

2.) There is a need to eliminate the deprecated string.h functions, because these won't support bounds checking.
